.. contents:: Topics

This changelog describes changes after version 1.0.0.

v2.2.1
======

Release Summary
---------------

This release brings some new features and enables compatibility with ansible-core-2.19.
The inventory now tries to lookup winrm services for Windows hosts if enabled.
The unset_ansible_port option was added to the inventory. It allows to control if the value of ansible_port should be unset if no non-default value was found.
The hidden_fields argument was added to kubevirt_vm and kubevirt_{vm,vmi}_info which allows to hide and ignore certain fields in the returned definition of a VM or VMI.
If no namespaces were configured the inventory now tries to use OCP Projects if available.
It is now possible to switch between running and run_strategy with kubevirt_vm.
This is a maintenance release with no functional changes compared to version 2.2.0. Only the changelog was fixed.
